# 3D Vision and Video - Practical Works

This repository contains practical works completed during the "IMA208: 3D Vision and Video" course at Télécom Paris.

## Course Overview

IMA208 is a second-year course that delves into advanced image acquisition processes, focusing on two key aspects of imaged scenes:

1. Temporal evolution of scenes, emphasizing video processing techniques.
2. Three-dimensional nature of scenes before their projection onto 2D sensors.

The course covers a wide range of topics including motion estimation in videos, object tracking, camera calibration, stereovision, and 3D point cloud processing.

## Practical Works

This repository includes seven practical works:

1. **TP1-Motion_Estimation**
   - Introduction to motion estimation techniques in video sequences

2. **TP2-Motion_Estimation**
   - Advanced motion estimation methods, possibly including deep learning approaches

3. **TP3-Kalman_Filtering**
   - Implementation of Kalman filter for object tracking in videos

4. **TP4-Particle_Filtering**
   - Exploration of particle filtering techniques for object tracking

5. **TP5-Homography_Estimation**
   - Estimating homographies for image alignment and perspective correction

6. **TP6-Camera_Calibration**
   - Techniques for camera calibration and stereovision

7. **TP7-Range_Scans_to_Meshes**
   - Processing 3D point clouds and reconstructing surfaces

## Course Structure

The course is divided into four main parts:
1. Motion estimation in videos
2. Object tracking in videos
3. Camera calibration and stereovision
4. 3D point cloud processing

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SciPy

## How to Use

Each practical work is contained in its own directory. You'll find Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts along with any necessary data files. To run the practicals:

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required dependencies
3. Navigate to the specific TP directory
4. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script

## Note

These practical works were completed as part of the coursework and are intended for educational purposes. They demonstrate the application of 3D vision and video processing techniques to real-world problems.
